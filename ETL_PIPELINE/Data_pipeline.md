# Introduction to Data Pipelines


## What is a Data Pipeline?

A data pipeline is a series of processes where the output of one is the input to the next, similar to a relay race. This sequential process is used to move or modify data.

### Performance Metrics

- **Latency:** The time it takes for a data packet to travel through the pipeline. It's influenced by the slowest stage in the process.
- **Throughput:** The amount of data passing through the pipeline over a given time. Larger data packets can improve throughput.

## Data Pipeline Use Cases

- Copying data from one place to another (e.g., backups).
- Integrating various data sources into a data lake.
- Transferring data to a data warehouse.
- Streaming from IoT devices to dashboards or alerts.
- Processing data for machine learning.
- Facilitating message exchange (email, SMS, video calls).
